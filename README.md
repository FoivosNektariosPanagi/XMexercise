# XM Homepage Exercise

This project is a front-end exercise for the UI Developer position at XM, built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.

## Exercise Overview

I was provided with a Figma file for the XM homepage exercise. Using this, I developed responsive designs tailored for three screen sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Vercel. You can view it live at [https://x-mexercise.vercel.app/](https://x-mexercise.vercel.app/).
